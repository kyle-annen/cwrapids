                    <div class="coach_type">A Sport for Everyone, For Life</div>
                    The sport of Track & Field has a long and storied past. The words above are the motto of USATF, and we believe in this whole heartedly.
                    <div class="coach_type">Everyone Is a Coach, Everyone is a Student</div>
                    While there are some general truths in Track & Field, and in each event, there is something we can all learn from each other.  Be open to new things, and be open to something of value coming from each member.
                    <div class="coach_type">Hard-Work Beats Talent, When Talent Doesn't Work Hard</div>
                    Track & Field is one of the unique sports where if you work hard enough, everyone can find success. A large portion of our coaches grew up in the Clearwater Valley and competed at a high level in the NCAA, NJCAA, and the NAIA.
                    <br><br>
                    None of us were exceptionally talented or the optimum body shape.  We worked hard for hours a day, many days a week, for years.  Success does not come easy, but the hardwork will repay you many times over in character, achievement and love for a sport which lasts a life-time.
                    <div class="coach_type">Track & Field is Fun!</div>
                    For the coaches, Track & Field is just about our favorite thing in the world.  Sometimes we get a bit over excited.  You can let us know if we need to calm down a bit!
